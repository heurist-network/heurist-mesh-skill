# Inflow Payment Platform

*This payment method is a placeholder and not yet fully integrated.*

Inflow is an agentic payment platform. Heurist acts as a seller, allowing users and AI agents to pay for Mesh services through Inflow's unified payment interface.

## Planned Flow

1. User registers on Inflow platform
2. User queries Heurist for service info and pricing
3. User authorizes payment
4. Heurist charges via Inflow API
5. Heurist delivers service result

More details will be added when the integration is complete.
